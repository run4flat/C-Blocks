  [API CHANGES]
  
  * Shared libraries are now indicated with the package array
    @C::Blocks::libraries_to_link rather than the package scalar
    $C::Blocks::library_to_link.
  
  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Bumped Alien::TinyCCx dependency to v0.08.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * csub works!
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Can now link multiple shared libraries to a single block, though
    the functionality is not yet tested.
  
  * Using sigiled variables automatically loads the PerlAPI symtab.
  
  [NEW FEATURES]
  
  * Added interpolation blocks! It is now possible to use Perl to
    produce C code. They're kinda like fancy C macros, sorta.
  
  * Added cisa, providing a system akin to typemaps.
  
  * Added C::Blocks::Object::Magic, a port of XS::Object::Magic. This
    makes it much easier to safely attach C structs to Perl variables.
  
  [OTHER]
  
  * The use of preprocessor branching in Blocks.xs has been cleaned
    up a bit, which will hopefully make the distribution more robust.

  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Added explicit dependency on ExtUtils::ParseXS v3.0. With prior
    versions, if you had multiple .xs files, the boot sections would
    collide in very, very strange ways. The default EU::PXS for v5.14
    (on perlbrew at least) is old, so this ensures correctness.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Revised symbol detection and building logic for Linux systems
  
  * Scrubbed various command-line preprocessor defines which sometimes
    caused trouble on Debian systems. Similar corrections will surely be
    needed for other flavors of linux.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Sigil variable incorporation works for much older Perls
  
  * Can now incorporate sigiled variables with @ and % sigils
  
  * Gentle name mangling means C variables can have the same name as
    Perl variables
  
  * Much more robust handling of sigil characters and braces in quoted
    strings, as well as braces in comments
