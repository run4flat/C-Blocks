0.04  Ddd, Mth #, 201#

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Added interpolation blocks!

0.03  Fri, Dec 4, 2015

  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Added explicit dependency on ExtUtils::ParseXS v3.0. With prior
    versions, if you had multiple .xs files, the boot sections would
    collide in very, very strange ways. The default EU::PXS for v5.14
    (on perlbrew at least) is old, so this ensures correctness.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Revised symbol detection and building logic for Linux systems
  
  * Scrubbed various command-line preprocessor defines which sometimes
    caused trouble on Debian systems. Similar corrections will surely be
    needed for other flavors of linux.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Sigil variable incorporation works for much older Perls
  
  * Can now incorporate sigiled variables with @ and % sigils
  
  * Gentle name mangling means C variables can have the same name as
    Perl variables
  
  * Much more robust handling of sigil characters and braces in quoted
    strings, as well as braces in comments
